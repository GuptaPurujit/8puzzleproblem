# 8-puzzle problem solving using uniformed algorithms 

### The Algorithms provided in the code are 
1. Depth First Search (DFS)
2. Breadth First Search (BFS)
3. Depth Limited Search 
4. Depth First Search with Iterative Deepning 

#### Usage 
1. Clone the repo 
2. Then run the "main.py" file using the command `python3 main.py` in the Terminal window.
3. Then the program will the ask the alogrithm from which you want the result
4. Upon entering the result you get the solution i.e the depth, number of searches and also the intermediate states
